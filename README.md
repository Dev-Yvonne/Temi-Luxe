# Temi Luxe — Static Marketing Site (demo)

A small, responsive static site scaffold for the Temi Luxe brand (HTML/CSS/JS). Meant as a starting point for a brochure/e‑commerce front page.

## What I built
- `index.html` — accessible, semantic markup
- `css/styles.css` — responsive design and branding tokens
- `js/main.js` — tiny interaction (nav + newsletter demo)
- `assets/*` — placeholder logo and illustrations

## Preview
- Open `index.html` in your browser, or
- Install Live Server and run:

  npm install --save-dev live-server
  npm run start

## Next steps (pick one)
1. Replace images & copy with your brand assets (logo, product photography).
2. Add a store backend (Shopify/WooCommerce/Stripe + serverless checkout).
3. Convert to React/Vite if you want a component-driven dev flow.

## Need help?
Tell me: preferred pages, real logo/photos, and whether you want an online checkout — I can implement the next step.
